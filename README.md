# wot - The Web of Trust

https://www.wot.info/ is a fresh take on the web of trust. 

Built on the Ethereum Attestation Service, it will provide trusted information in a digital world swamped by fakes, bots, machines and inflationary content.

The app will eventually produce a wide variety of reliable results, such as:​

ActorXYZ = human

This content was created by = human

This content was created by = ActorXYZ

SpringBunny23 = human

Superheroe97 ≠ human

…and at some later stage also:

I can trust this information / person / actor to degree = x (0-100%)

# Dynamic equity split

As soon as possible, shares of ownership in the wot - Web of Trust will be sold to the public. There will be an auction approach, where shares of 1% of ownership are sold consecutively through an online auction.

In this, an initial price of say 100 Ether for a 1% share will decrease to 1 Ether over 21 days (slope of curve to be decided). As soon as one 1% share has been sold off, the next auction for the next 1% share begins.

After the sale of a first tranche of 10%, a market valuation is available. Cash and work contributions will then be attributed according to their value.

This dynamic or liquid equity split will be the standard for all future transactions. Anyone will be able to see the value of the Web of Trust and of their shares in it in real-time.
